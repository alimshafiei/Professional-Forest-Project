1. Creating Random Forest Model (Using GridSearch CV)

Goal: Creating a Robust Model

Step1 to Step4

2. Creating Professional Forest (By Using GridSearch CV)

Goal: Improving the performance of the Random Forest model by simultaneously using the GridSearch CV and the Professional Forest Methodology.

Scenario 1:

Based on (Using GridSearch CV + Trees Score)

*Primary Forest=1000 Trees, Professional Forest=200 Trees, Creating Trees with best Params

3. Creating Professional Forest (Without Using GridSearch CV)

Goal: Checking the Power of Professional Forest without Using gridSearch CV

Scenario 2:

Based on (Trees Score)

*primary forest=2000, professional forest=100, Using Naturaly and Randomly Trees

4. Creating Professional Forest (Without Using GridSearch CV)

Goal: Investigating the impact of model compression on model performance (Speed vs. Performance)

Scenario 3:

Based on (Trees Score + Using Very High Quality Trees)

*Primary Forest=4000 Trees, Professional Forest= 50 Trees, Allowing Growth Naturaly and Randomly In Large Number of Trees  and Selecting Very High Quality Trees

Conclusion
