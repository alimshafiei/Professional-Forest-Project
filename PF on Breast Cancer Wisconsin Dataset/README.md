# Professional Forest Methodology

## Creating Random Forest Model (Using GridSearch CV)
### Goal: Creating a Robust Model
- **Step 1 to Step 4**

## Creating Professional Forest (By Using GridSearch CV)
### Goal: Improving the performance of the Random Forest model by simultaneously using the GridSearch CV and the Professional Forest Methodology.

### Scenario 1:
**Based on (Using GridSearch CV + Trees Score)**

- Primary Forest: 1000 Trees
- Professional Forest: 200 Trees
- Creating Trees with best Params

## Creating Professional Forest (Without Using GridSearch CV)
### Goal: Checking the Power of Professional Forest without Using GridSearch CV

### Scenario 2:
**Based on (Trees Score)**

- Primary Forest: 2000 Trees
- Professional Forest: 100 Trees
- Using Naturally and Randomly Generated Trees

## Analysis
### Performance Metrics
All models show identical performance metrics across accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This consistency highlights the robustness of the PF approach, even when selecting different numbers of top-performing trees.

### Computational Efficiency
The PF model with 100 trees selected from 2000 demonstrates that we can achieve the same performance as the well-tuned RF model with significantly fewer trees. This reduction in model complexity can lead to faster prediction times and lower resource usage.

### Versatility of PF Approach
Both scenarios of PF (200 top trees from 1000 and 100 top trees from 2000) show that the PF method can maintain high performance with different configurations. This flexibility allows for efficient model optimization depending on resource constraints and requirements.

## Conclusion
The PF approach, whether selecting 200 top trees from 1000 trees (using GridSearch CV) or 100 top trees from 2000 trees (without using GridSearch CV), effectively maintains the high performance of the original Random Forest model with fewer trees. This not only preserves accuracy and other key metrics but also enhances computational efficiency, making PF a valuable strategy in various scenarios.

## Creating Professional Forest (Without Using GridSearch CV)
### Goal: Investigating the impact of model compression on model performance (Speed vs. Performance)

### Scenario 3:
**Based on (Trees Score + Using Very High Quality Trees)**

- Primary Forest: 4000 Trees
- Professional Forest: 50 Trees
- Allowing Growth Naturally and Randomly in a Large Number of Trees and Selecting Very High Quality Trees

## Analysis
### Consistency in Accuracy
All models, including the PF with 50 trees, maintained an accuracy of 0.96, demonstrating the robustness of the PF approach even with fewer trees.

### Slight Variations in Precision and Recall
- **Precision**: The PF model with 50 trees shows a very slight reduction in precision for Class 0 (0.95) compared to the other models (0.98).
- **Recall**: The recall for Class 1 is slightly lower in the PF model with 50 trees (0.97) compared to the others (0.99).

### F1-Score
The F1-score for both classes in the PF model with 50 trees is marginally lower than the other models but still high (0.94 for Class 0 and 0.97 for Class 1).

### Efficiency Gains
Despite the slight variations, the PF model with 50 trees achieves comparable performance to the RF and other PF models while significantly reducing the number of trees. This translates into faster predictions and potentially lower computational costs.

## Conclusion
The PF approach with 50 trees from a primary forest of 4000 maintains high performance, similar to the well-tuned RF model and the PF with 100 trees. The slight differences in precision and recall are minor and acceptable, especially given the efficiency gains from using fewer trees if we need a "tiny" and "very fast" model.

## Final Conclusion
By using the Professional Forest approach, we can create "tiny", "impactful", "robust", and "very fast" models without needing to use GridSearch CV.
